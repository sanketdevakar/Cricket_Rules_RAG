Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)

THE PREFACE
The game of Cricket has been governed by a series of Codes of Laws for over 275 years.
These Codes have been subject to additions and alterations recommended by the governing
authorities of the time. Since its formation in 1787, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has
been recognised as the sole authority for drawing up the Code and for all subsequent
amendments. The Club also holds the World Copyright.
The basic Laws of Cricket have stood the test of time remarkably well. While the game has
evolved over generations, it remains recognisably the same sport as in decades and centuries
gone by. The Laws today may be longer and more complex than the earliest Codes in the
18th Century, but they retain the same central core, and often some of the same language. It
is thought that one of the real reasons for this sustainability is not just the appeal of cricket as
a sport, but also that cricketers have traditionally been prepared to play in the Spirit of the
Game, recognised in the Preamble since 2000, as well as in accordance with the Laws.
That said, the game does evolve, and the Laws must do so with it. The changes made in the
2017 Code – of which this is the third edition - reflected views following a global
consultation with players, umpires and administrators at all levels of the game, including the
International Cricket Council, the sport’s global governing body. The game had evolved
quickly, requiring six Editions of the 2000 Code to be published in only fifteen years. A new
Code was necessary to rationalise these amendments and to list the Laws in a more logical
format and order.  The guiding objectives behind the 2017 changes, evidenced from the
consultation, were to maintain a fair balance between bat and ball, to make the Laws easier to
understand, to safeguard players’ welfare, and to give umpires more mechanisms to address
instances of poor behaviour by players. Those principles have continued to guide this third
edition, in which changes are intended to shape the game of cricket as it should be played,
rather than being reliant on outdated, if long-standing, traditions. With that in mind, for the
first time in 2017, the Laws were written in a gender-neutral format, reflecting, and further
encouraging, the rising popularity of the game amongst women and girls. This edition goes a
step further, replacing the old term ‘batsman’ with the gender-neutral ‘batter’ – reflecting that
cricket is a game for everyone, and that language shapes our behaviours.
The MCC Laws of Cricket provide the framework around which all cricket matches are
based. Individual leagues and governing bodies then add their own playing regulations on
top, amending the Laws to suit the differing needs of, for example, matches in junior cricket,
T20 matches and Test matches. In almost all cases, the fundamentals of the game, such as
scoring runs and taking wickets, remain unchanged in such regulations.
The Laws contained in this book are correct at the time of its publication but the MCC
website (www.lords.org) and Laws of Cricket App provide a digital version which will be
updated with any minor changes, if necessary.
Significant dates in the history of the Laws are as follows:
1700 Cricket was recognised as early as this date.
1744 The earliest known Code was drawn up by certain “Noblemen and Gentlemen” who
used the Artillery Ground in London.
1755 The Laws were revised by “Several Cricket Clubs, particularly the Star and Garter in
Pall Mall”.
1774 A further revision was produced by “a Committee of Noblemen and Gentlemen of
Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex and London at the Star and Garter”.

1786 A further revision was undertaken by a similar body of Noblemen and Gentlemen of
Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex and London.
1788 The first MCC Code of Laws was adopted on 30 May.
1835 A new Code of Laws was approved by the MCC Committee on 19 May.
1884 After consultation with cricket clubs worldwide, important alterations were
incorporated in a new version approved at an MCC Special General Meeting on 21
April.
1947 A new Code of Laws was approved at an MCC Special General Meeting on 7 May. The
main changes were aimed at achieving clarification and better arrangement of the Laws
and their interpretations.
1979 After five editions of the 1947 Code, a further revision was begun in 1974 with the aim
being to remove certain anomalies, consolidate various Amendments and Notes, and to
achieve greater clarity and simplicity. The new Code of Laws was approved at an
MCC Special General Meeting on 21 November, coming into effect in 1980.
1992 A second edition of the 1980 Code was produced, incorporating all the amendments
which were approved during the intervening twelve years.
2000 A new Code of Laws, including a Preamble defining the Spirit of Cricket, was
approved on 3 May.
2007 MCC established the Laws sub-committee, replacing the Laws Working Party.
2010 A fourth edition of the 2000 Code was published. MCC members agreed at a Special
General Meeting on 5 May that the MCC Committee is entitled to change the Laws of
Cricket without seeking the approval of the members.
2017 After six Editions of the 2000 Code, a new 2017 Code came into effect on 1 October. A
second Edition was published in April 2019.
Many queries on the Laws are sent to MCC for decision every year. MCC, as the accepted
Custodian of the Laws, has always been prepared to answer the queries and to give
interpretations. However, MCC reserves the right not to answer queries which it considers to
be frivolous or connected in any way with a bet or wager.

THE PREAMBLE – THE SPIRIT OF CRICKET
Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only
according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket.
The major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all
players, match officials and, especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents.
Respect is central to the Spirit of Cricket.
•
Respect your captain, teammates, opponents and the authority of the
umpires.
•
Play hard and play fair.
•
Accept the umpire’s decision.
•
Create a positive atmosphere by your own conduct, and encourage others to do
likewise.
•
Show self-discipline, even when things go against you.
•
Congratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own
team.
•
Thank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the
result.
Cricket is an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which
brings together people from different nationalities, cultures and religions, especially when
played within the Spirit of Cricket.
The players, umpires and scorers in a game of cricket may be of any gender, and the Laws
apply equally. The use, throughout the text, of pronouns expressing a binary he/she is as
inclusive as practicable, whilst retaining clarity. Except where specifically stated otherwise,
every provision of the Laws is to be read as applying to all persons, regardless of gender.

LAW 1
THE PLAYERS
1.1 Number of players
A match is played between two sides, each of eleven players, one of whom shall be captain.
By agreement a match may be played between sides of fewer than, or more than, eleven
players, but not more than eleven players may field at any time.
If, during the match and for whatever reason, a side is reduced to fewer than the original
number of nominated players, the match shall continue as long as it is possible to do so
under the Laws or any agreements made before the toss.
1.2 Nomination and replacement of players
1.2.1 Each captain shall nominate his/her players in writing to one of the umpires before the
toss.

captain.
1.2.3 Any replacement player shall be considered the same player as the nominated player
he/she replaced for the purposes of these Laws.
1.2.3.1 A replacement shall not bat in an innings in which the nominated player he/she is
replacing has completed his/her innings.
1.2.3.2 Any unserved Penalty time, warnings or suspensions, that applied to the original

1.3 Captain
1.3.1 If at any time the captain is not available, a deputy shall act for him/her.

Laws, including at the toss. See Law 13.4 (The toss).
1.4 Responsibility of captains
The captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within The

Law 41.1 (Fair and unfair play – responsibility of captains).
LAW 2
THE UMPIRES
2.1 Appointment and attendance
Before the match, two umpires shall be appointed, one for each end, to control the match as
required by the Laws, with absolute impartiality. The umpires shall be present on the ground
and report to the Executive of the ground at least 45 minutes before the scheduled start of
each day’s play.
2.2 Change of umpire
An umpire shall not be changed during the match, other than in exceptional circumstances,
unless he/she is injured or ill. If there has to be a change of umpire, the replacement shall
act only as the striker’s end umpire unless the captains agree that the replacement should
take full responsibility as an umpire.
2.3 Consultation with captains
Before the toss the umpires shall
2.3.1 meet with the captains; the umpires shall determine
2.3.1.1 the balls to be used during the match. See Law 4 (The ball).
2.3.1.2 the hours of play and the times and durations of any agreed intervals. In a
match of one day’s duration, no specific time need be agreed for the tea
interval. It may be agreed instead to take this interval between innings. See

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
7
Law 11 (Intervals).
2.3.1.3 which clock or watch and back-up timepiece is to be used during the match.
2.3.1.4 the boundary of the field of play and allowances for boundaries, including
whether any obstacle within the field of play is to be regarded as a boundary.
See Law 19 (Boundaries).
2.3.1.5 the use of covers. See Law 10 (Covering the pitch).
2.3.1.6 any special conditions of play affecting the conduct of the match.
2.3.2 inform the scorers of agreements in 2.3.1.2, 2.3.1.3, 2.3.1.4 and 2.3.1.6.
2.4 The wickets, creases and boundaries
Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that
2.4.1 the creases are correctly marked. See Law 7 (The creases).
2.4.2 the wickets are properly pitched. See Law 8 (The wickets).
2.4.3 the boundary of the field of play complies with the requirements of Laws 19.1
(Determining the boundary of the field of play), 19.2 (Identifying and marking the
boundary) and 19.3 (Restoring the boundary).
2.5 Conduct of the match, implements and equipment
Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that

2.5.2.3 either Laws 8.2 (Size of stumps) and 8.3 (The bails) or, if applicable, Law 8.4
(Junior cricket).
2.5.3 no player uses equipment other than that permitted. See Appendix A.2. Note
particularly therein the interpretation of ‘protective helmet’.
2.5.4 the wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of Law 27.2 (Gloves).
2.6 Fair and unfair play
The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play.
2.7 Fitness for play
2.7.1 It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground,
weather or light or exceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or
unreasonable for play to take place.
Conditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely
because they are not ideal.
The fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions
being regarded as unreasonable or dangerous.
2.7.2 Conditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to
the safety of any player or umpire.
2.7.3 Conditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it
would not be sensible for play to proceed.
2.7.4 If the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a
reasonable foothold, the fielders of the power of free movement, or the batters of the
ability to play their strokes or to run between the wickets, then these conditions shall
be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and unreasonable for play to take
place.

2.8 Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable circumstances
2.8.1 All references to ground include the pitch. See Law 6.1 (Area of pitch).
2.8.2  The Umpires shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to start or to
recommence, if either umpire considers that the conditions of ground, weather or
light, or any other circumstances are either dangerous or unreasonable.
2.8.3 When there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor
conditions. They shall make inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by
any players or officials. Immediately the umpires together agree that the conditions
are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the players to resume
play.
2.9 Position of umpires
The umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be
required.
Subject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so
as not to interfere with either the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view.
The striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the off side instead of the on side of the
pitch, provided he/she informs the captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other
umpire.
2.10 Umpires changing ends
The umpires shall change ends after each side has had one completed innings. See Law
13.3 (Completed innings).
2.11 Disagreement and dispute
Where there is disagreement or dispute about any matter, the umpires together shall make
the final decision. See also Law 31.6 (Consultation by umpires).
2.12 Umpire’s decision
An umpire may alter any decision provided that such alteration is made promptly and does
not contradict Law 20.6 (Dead ball not to be revoked). This apart, an umpire’s decision,

that for Short run, which is to be signalled by the umpire at the end where
short running occurs. However, the bowler’s end umpire shall be responsible
both for the final signal of Short run to the scorers and, if more than one run is
short, for informing them as to the number of runs to be recorded.
2.13.2 The umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately
acknowledged by a scorer before allowing play to proceed.
If several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events
occurred.
2.14 Informing the umpires
Throughout the Laws, wherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or
other players, it will be sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform
the other umpire.
2.15 Correctness of scores
Consultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential. The umpires
shall, throughout the match, satisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs
scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where appropriate, the number of overs bowled.
They shall agree these with the scorers at least at every interval, other than a drinks
interval, and at the conclusion of the match. See Laws 3.2 (Correctness of scores), 16.8
(Correctness of result) and 16.10 (Result not to be changed).

the match, the runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where appropriate, the number
of overs bowled. See Law 2.15 (Correctness of scores).

the batters and the scorers whenever a new ball is taken into play.
4.5 Ball lost or becoming unfit for play
If, during play, the ball cannot be found or recovered or the umpires agree that it has
become unfit for play through normal use, the umpires shall replace it with a ball which has

LAW 6
THE PITCH
6.1 Area of pitch
The pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards/20.12 m in length and 10 ft/3.05 m in
width. It is bounded at either end by the bowling creases and on either side by imaginary
lines, one each side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps, each
parallel to it and 5 ft/1.52 m from it. If the pitch is next to an artificial pitch which is closer
than 5 ft/1.52 m from the middle stumps, the pitch on that side will extend only to the
junction of the two surfaces. See 6.6, Law 8.1 (Description, width and pitching), Law 7.2
(The bowling crease) and Appendix C.
6.2 Fitness of pitch for play
The umpires shall be the sole judges of the fitness of the pitch for play. See Laws 2.7
(Fitness for play) and 2.8 (Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable conditions).
6.3 Selection and preparation
Before the match, the Ground Authority shall be responsible for the selection and
preparation of the pitch. During the match, the umpires shall control its use and
maintenance.
6.4 Changing the pitch
The pitch shall not be changed during the match unless the umpires decide that it is
dangerous or unreasonable for play to continue on it and then only with the consent of both
captains.

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
13

account of the 10-minute interval between innings, which shall be considered as

than an interval for drinks, provided that at least 10 minutes remains of the interval,
the interval shall be of the agreed duration and shall be considered to include the

when the captain declares the innings closed, or forfeits an innings, the interval shall
be extended as necessary and the next innings shall commence 10 minutes after
the declaration or forfeiture is made.
11.4 Changing agreed times of intervals
If, at any time during the match,
either Playing time is lost through adverse conditions of ground, weather or light or in
exceptional circumstances,
or       the players have occasion to leave the field other than at a scheduled interval,
the time of the lunch interval or of the tea interval may be changed if the two umpires and

agreed duration. Play shall resume at the end of this interval or as soon after as
conditions permit.
11.5.3 If the players have occasion to leave the field for any reason when more than 10
minutes remains before the agreed time for lunch then, unless the umpires and

circumstances, a stoppage occurs when 30 minutes or less remains before the
agreed time for tea, then unless

or the captains agree to forgo the tea interval, as permitted in 11.9
the interval shall be taken immediately. The interval shall be of the agreed duration.
Play shall resume at the end of the interval or as soon after as conditions permit.

final ball of the over in progress at the agreed time for the interval,
then the provisions of Law 12.5.2 shall not apply and the interval will not be taken until the
end of the over that is in progress 30 minutes after the originally agreed time for the interval,
unless the players have cause to leave the field of play or the innings is completed earlier.

whether this occurs during an over or at the end of an over. Except at the end of an
innings, if an over is thus interrupted it shall be completed on the resumption of play.

When one hour of Playing time of the match remains, according to the agreed hours of play,
the over in progress shall be completed. The next over shall be the first of a minimum of 20
overs which must be bowled, provided that a result is not reached earlier and provided that
there is no interval or interruption in play.
The bowler’s end umpire shall indicate the commencement of this 20 overs to the players
and to the scorers. The period of play thereafter shall be referred to as the Last hour,

aggregated; the calculation shall be made for each interruption separately.
12.7.4 If, when one hour of Playing time remains, an interruption is already in progress
12.7.4.1 only the time lost after this moment shall be counted in the calculation.
12.7.4.2 the over in progress at the start of the interruption shall be completed on
resumption and shall not count as one of the minimum number of overs to be
bowled.
12.7.5 If, after the start of the Last hour, an interruption occurs during an over, the over shall
be completed on resumption of play. The two part-overs shall between them count
as one over of the minimum number to be bowled.
12.8 Last hour of match – intervals between innings
If an innings ends so that a new innings is to be started during the Last hour of the match,
the interval starts with the end of the innings and is to end 10 minutes later.
12.8.1 If this interval is already in progress at the start of the Last hour then, to determine
the number of overs to be bowled in the new innings, calculations are to be made as
set out in 12.7.

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
20
12.8.2 If the innings ends after the Last hour has started, two calculations are to be made,
as set out in 12.8.3 and 12.8.4. The greater of the numbers yielded by these two
calculations is to be the minimum number of overs to be bowled in the new innings.
12.8.3 Calculation based on overs remaining:
- At the conclusion of the innings, the number of overs that remain to be bowled, of
the minimum in the Last hour, to be noted.
- If this is not a whole number it is to be rounded up to the next whole number.
- Three overs, for the interval, to be deducted from the resulting number to
determine the number of overs still to be bowled.
12.8.4 Calculation based on time remaining:
- At the conclusion of the innings, the time remaining until the agreed time for close
of play to be noted.
- 10 minutes, for the interval, to be deducted from this time to determine the Playing
time remaining.
- A calculation to be made of one over for every complete 3 minutes of the Playing
time remaining, plus one more over if a further part of 3 minutes remains.

The result of a match shall be a Draw when it is not determined in any of the ways
stated in 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5.1, or when Law 42.6.2 (Captain refusing to
remove a player from the field) is applied.
16.6 Winning hit or extras
16.6.1 As soon as a result is reached as defined in 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4 or 16.5.1, the
match is at an end. Nothing that happens thereafter, except as in Law 41.17.2
(Penalty runs), shall be regarded as part of it. Note also 16.9.
16.6.2 The side batting last will have scored enough runs to win only if its total of runs is

of a catch, or the obstruction of a catch, from which the striker could be dismissed.

match, the whole of the boundary allowance shall be credited to the side’s total and,
in the case of a hit by the bat, to the striker’s score.
16.7 Statement of result
If the side batting last wins the match without losing all its wickets, the result shall be stated
as a win by the number of wickets still then to fall.
If, without having scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side,
the innings of the side batting last has been completed, but as the result of an award of 5
Penalty runs its total of runs is then sufficient to win, the result shall be stated as a win to
that side by Penalty runs.
If the side fielding last wins the match, the result shall be stated as a win by runs.
If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be
stated as Match Conceded or Match Awarded, as the case may be.
16.8 Correctness of result
Any decision as to the correctness of the scores shall be the responsibility of the umpires.
See Law 2.15 (Correctness of scores).
16.9 Mistakes in scoring
If, after the players and umpires have left the field in the belief that the match has been
concluded, the umpires discover that a mistake in scoring has occurred which affects the
result then, subject to 16.10, they shall adopt the following procedure.
16.9.1 If, when the players leave the field, the side batting last has not completed its
innings and
either the number of overs to be bowled in the Last hour, or in that innings, has not
been completed

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
24
or the agreed time for close of play, or for the end of the innings, has not been
reached
then, unless one side concedes defeat, the umpires shall order play to resume.
Unless a result is reached sooner, play will then continue, if conditions permit, until
the prescribed number of overs has been completed and either time for close of play
has been reached or the allotted time for the innings has expired, as appropriate. The
number of overs and time remaining shall be taken as they were at the call of Time for
the supposed conclusion of the match. No account shall be taken of the time
between that moment and the resumption of play.
16.9.2 If, at this call of Time, the overs have been completed and no Playing time remains,
or if the side batting last has completed its innings, the umpires shall immediately
inform both captains of the necessary corrections to the scores and to the result.
16.10 Result not to be changed
Once the umpires have agreed with the scorers the correctness of the scores at the
conclusion of the match – see Laws 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of
scores) – the result cannot thereafter be changed.

It is unfair if the bowler fails to notify the umpire of a change in his/her mode of
delivery. In this case the umpire shall call and signal No ball.
21.1.2 Underarm bowling shall not be permitted except by special agreement before the
match.
21.2 Fair delivery – the arm
For a delivery to be fair in respect of the arm the ball must not be thrown.
A ball is fairly delivered in respect of the arm if, once the bowler’s arm has reached the level
of the shoulder in the delivery swing, the elbow joint is not straightened partially or
completely from that instant until the ball has left the hand. This definition shall not debar a
bowler from flexing or rotating the wrist in the delivery swing.
Although it is the primary responsibility of the striker’s end umpire to assess the fairness of
a delivery in this respect, there is nothing in this Law to debar the bowler’s end umpire from
calling and signalling No ball if he/she considers that the ball has been thrown.
21.3 Ball thrown or delivered underarm – action by umpires
21.3.1 After the bowler has entered his/her delivery stride, if in the opinion of either umpire
the ball has been thrown or, unless permitted by agreement in 21.1.2, delivered
underarm, that umpire shall call and signal No ball and, when the ball is dead, inform
the other umpire of the reason for the call.
The bowler’s end umpire shall then
- warn the bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall
apply to that bowler throughout the innings.
- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action.
- inform the batters at the wicket of what has occurred.
21.3.2 If either umpire considers that, in that innings, a further delivery by the same bowler is
thrown or, unless permitted by agreement in 21.1.2, delivered underarm, he/she shall
call and signal No ball and when the ball is dead inform the other umpire of the
reason for the call.
The bowler’s end umpire shall then
- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from
bowling. The over shall, if applicable, be completed by another bowler, who shall
neither have bowled the previous over or part thereof nor be allowed to bowl any
part of the next over. The bowler thus suspended shall not bowl again in that
innings.

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
33
- inform the batters at the wicket and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the
batting side of the reason for this action.
21.3.3 The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match
to the Executive of the offending side and to any Governing Body responsible for the
match, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the captain,
any other individuals concerned and, if appropriate, the team.
21.4 Bowler throwing towards striker’s end before delivery
If the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering the delivery stride, it
is not a No ball and the procedure stated in 21.3 shall not apply. However, the umpire shall
call and signal Dead ball under Law 20.4.2.9.
21.5 Fair delivery – the feet
For a delivery to be fair in respect of the feet, in the delivery stride
21.5.1  the bowler’s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease on the
side of his/her stated mode of delivery.
21.5.2 the bowler’s front foot must land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or
raised
-
on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two middle stumps as the return
crease described in 21.5.1, and
-
behind the popping crease.
If the bowler’s end umpire is not satisfied that all of these three conditions have been met,
he/she shall call and signal No ball. See Law 41.8 (Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball).
21.6 Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball
If the ball is delivered and if the non-striker is not dismissed under Law 38.3 (Non-striker
leaving his/her ground early), either umpire shall call and signal No ball if the bowler breaks
the wicket at any time after the ball comes into play and before completion of the stride after
the delivery stride. This shall include any clothing or other object that falls from his/her person
and breaks the wicket. See Appendix A.12. Laws 20.4.2.8, 20.4.2.10 (Umpire calling and
signalling Dead ball) and 21.12 will apply.
21.7 Ball bouncing more than once, rolling along the ground or pitching off the pitch
The umpire shall call and signal No ball if a ball which he/she considers to have been
delivered, without having previously touched bat or person of the striker,
- bounces more than once or rolls along the ground before it reaches the popping crease
or
- pitches wholly or partially off the pitch as defined in Law 6.1 (Area of pitch) before it
reaches the line of the striker’s wicket. When a non-turf pitch is being used, this will
apply to any ball that wholly or partially pitches off the artificial surface.
21.8 Ball causing the striker to leave the pitch, or ball coming to rest in front of striker’s wicket
If a ball delivered by the bowler comes to rest in front of the line of the striker’s wicket or is
so far from the pitch that the striker would need to leave the pitch to attempt to play the ball
(see Law 25.8 – Striker’s right to play the ball), without having previously touched the bat or
person of the striker, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and immediately call and signal
Dead ball.
21.9 Fielder intercepting a delivery
If, except in the circumstances of Law 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper), a ball delivered by
the bowler makes contact with any part of a fielder’s person before it either makes contact
with the striker’s bat or person, or it passes the striker’s wicket, the umpire shall call and
signal No ball and immediately call and signal Dead ball.

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
34
21.10 Ball bouncing over head height of striker
The umpire shall call and signal No ball for any delivery which, after pitching, passes or
would have passed over head height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease.
21.11 Call of No ball for infringement of other Laws
In addition to the instances above, No ball is to be called and signalled as required by the
following Laws.
Law 27.3 – Position of wicket-keeper

other runs scored, any boundary allowance and any other runs awarded for penalties.
21.16 Runs resulting from a No ball – how scored
The one-run penalty shall be scored as a No ball extra and shall be debited against the
bowler. If other Penalty runs have been awarded to either side these shall be scored as
stated in Law 41.17 (Penalty runs). Any runs completed by the batters or any boundary
allowance shall be credited to the striker if the ball has been struck by the bat; otherwise
they shall also be scored as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate.
21.17 No ball not to count
A No ball shall not count as one of the over. See Law 17.3 (Validity of balls).
21.18 Out from a No ball
When No ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Laws except 34
(Hit the ball twice), 37 (Obstructing the field) or 38 (Run out).
LAW 22
WIDE BALL
22.1 Judging a Wide
22.1.1 If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if,
according to the definition in 22.1.2, the ball passes wide of where the striker is standing
or has stood at any point after the ball came into play for that delivery, and which also
would have passed wide of the striker standing in a normal batting position.
22.1.2 The ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently
within reach for him/her to be able to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket
stroke.

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
35
22.2 Call and signal of Wide ball
If the umpire adjudges a delivery to be a Wide he/she shall call and signal Wide ball as

cannot be called Wide until it passes the striker’s wicket.
22.3 Revoking a call of Wide ball
22.3.1 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if there is any contact between the ball
and the striker’s bat or person before the ball comes into contact with any fielder.

21.13 (No ball to override Wide).

22.4.1 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving,
either causes the ball to pass wide of him/her, as defined in 22.1.2
or
brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by means of a
normal cricket stroke.
22.4.2 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide if the ball touches the
striker’s bat or person, but only as the ball passes the striker.
22.5 Ball not dead
The ball does not become dead on the call of Wide ball.
22.6 Penalty for a Wide
A penalty of one-run shall be awarded instantly on the call of Wide ball. Unless the call is

penalties.

his/her bat or person, any runs completed by the batters from that delivery, or a boundary
allowance, shall be credited as Byes to the batting side. Additionally, if the delivery is a No
ball, the one-run penalty for such a delivery shall be incurred.
23.2 Leg byes

scored as follows.
23.2.2.1 If there is
either   no subsequent contact with the striker’s bat or person,

any runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance shall be credited
to the striker in the case of subsequent contact with his/her bat but otherwise
to the batting side as in 23.2.3.

24.2.6.2 the fielder who was already off the field at the start of the break notifies an

the field) or 38 (Run out).
25.6.2 When a batter who has a runner is the striker he/she remains subject to the Laws
and will be liable to the penalties that any infringement of them demands. In the case
of Run out and Stumped, however, special provisions, set out in 25.6.3, 25.6.4 and
25.6.5, apply to him/her as a striker who has a runner.
25.6.3 When a batter who has a runner is the striker, his/her ground is always at the wicket-

conditions of Law 38 (Run out) shall apply.
25.6.5 If the striker who has a runner is out of his/her ground and the wicket at the wicket-
keeper’s end is fairly broken, the striker is liable to be out under Laws 38 (Run out) or

25.6.7.1 remains subject to Law 37 (Obstructing the field) but is otherwise out of the
match.
25.6.7.2 shall stand where directed by the striker’s end umpire so as not to interfere

have part of his/her person or bat grounded behind the popping crease until the ball
reaches the striker or passes the popping crease, whichever is the sooner.
25.7.2 If the striker’s end umpire considers the runner for an injured striker to be in breach

has been delivered, without interference from the wicket-keeper or any other fielder
(see Law 27.5 – Restrictions on actions of wicket-keeper and Law 27.6 –
Interference with wicket-keeper by striker).
However, the striker may only attempt to play the ball if some of his/her bat or
person, whether grounded or raised, remains within the pitch, as defined in Law 6.1
(Area of pitch). Should no part of the striker’s bat or person remain within the pitch,
whilst the striker is playing the ball, either umpire shall immediately call and signal
Dead ball.

match to the Executive of the offending side and to any Governing Body responsible
for the match, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the
captain, any other individuals concerned and, if appropriate, the team.
LAW 27
THE WICKET-KEEPER
27.1 Protective equipment
The wicket-keeper is the only fielder permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. If
these are worn, they are to be regarded as part of his/her person for the purposes of Law
28.2 (Fielding the ball). If by the wicket-keeper’s actions and positioning when the ball
comes into play it is apparent to the umpires that he/she will not be able to carry out the
normal duties of a wicket-keeper, he/she shall forfeit this right and also the right to be
recognised as a wicket-keeper for the purposes of Laws 33.2 (A fair catch), 39 (Stumped),
28.1 (Protective equipment), 28.4 (Limitation of on-side fielders) and 28.5 (Fielders not to
encroach on pitch).
27.2 Gloves
27.2.1 If, as permitted under 27.1, the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no
webbing between the fingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing
may be inserted as a means of support.
27.2.2 If used, the webbing shall be a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it
may have facing material attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks.
27.2.3 The top edge of the webbing shall not protrude beyond the straight line joining the
top of the index finger to the top of the thumb and shall be taut when a hand wearing
the glove has the thumb fully extended. See Appendix E.
27.3 Position of wicket-keeper
27.3.1 The wicket-keeper shall remain wholly behind the wicket at the striker’s end from the
moment the ball comes into play until a ball delivered by the bowler
touches the bat or person of the striker or
passes the wicket at the striker’s end or
the striker attempts a run.
27.3.2 In the event of the wicket-keeper contravening this Law, the striker’s end umpire
shall call and signal No ball as soon as applicable after the delivery of the ball.
27.4 Movement by wicket-keeper
27.4.1 After the ball comes into play and before it reaches the striker, it is unfair if the
wicket-keeper significantly alters his/her position in relation to the striker’s wicket,
except for the following:

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
42
27.4.1.1 movement of a few paces forward for a slower delivery, unless in so doing it
brings him/her within reach of the wicket.
27.4.1.2 lateral movement in response to the direction in which the ball has been
delivered.
27.4.1.3 movement in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his/her
actions suggest he/she intends to play. However the provisions of Law 27.3
shall apply.
27.4.2 In the event of unfair movement by the wicket-keeper, either umpire shall call and
signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for doing so. The
bowler’s end umpire shall then:
27.4.2.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable
27.4.2.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side
27.4.2.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action.
27.4.2.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side
of what has occurred.
The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to
the Executive of the offending side and to any Governing Body responsible for the
match, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the captain, any
other individuals concerned and, if appropriate, the team.
27.5 Restriction on actions of wicket-keeper
If, in the opinion of either umpire, the wicket-keeper interferes with the striker’s right to play
the ball and to guard his/her wicket, Law 20.4.2.6 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball)
shall apply.
If, however, either umpire considers that the interference by the wicket-keeper was wilful,
then Law 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker) shall also apply.
27.6 Interference with wicket-keeper by striker
If, in playing at the ball or in the legitimate defence of his/her wicket, the striker interferes
with the wicket-keeper, he/she shall not be out except as provided for in Law 37.3
(Obstructing a ball from being caught).
LAW 28
THE FIELDER
28.1 Protective equipment
No fielder other than the wicket-keeper shall be permitted to wear gloves or external leg
guards. In addition, protection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of
the umpires.
28.2 Fielding the ball
28.2.1 A fielder may field the ball with any part of his/her person (see Appendix A.12),
except as in 28.2.1.2. However, he/she will be deemed to have fielded the ball
illegally if, while the ball is in play he/she wilfully
28.2.1.1 uses anything other than part of his/her person to field the ball.
28.2.1.2 extends his/her clothing with his/her hands and uses this to field the ball.
28.2.1.3 discards a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object which

or been dropped by an umpire.
28.2.3 If a fielder illegally fields the ball, the ball shall immediately become dead and
- the penalty for a No ball or a Wide shall stand.

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
43
- any runs completed by the batters shall be credited to the batting side, together
with the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the
offence.
- the ball shall not count as one of the over.
In addition the umpire shall
- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side.
- inform the other umpire and the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this
action.
- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of
what has occurred.
The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match
to the Executive of the offending side and to any Governing Body responsible for the
match, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the captain,
any other individuals concerned and, if appropriate, the team.
28.3 Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side
28.3.1 Protective helmets, when not in use by fielders, may not be placed on the ground,
above the surface except behind the wicket-keeper and in line with both sets of
stumps.
28.3.2 If the ball while in play strikes the protective helmet, placed as described in 28.3.1,
the ball shall immediately become dead and, unless 28.3.3 applies:
-
the umpire shall signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable
-
the umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side
-
any runs completed by the batters before the ball strikes the protective helmet
shall be scored, together with the run in progress if the batters had already
crossed at the instant of the ball striking the protective helmet.
28.3.3 If the ball while in play strikes a helmet, placed as described in 28.3.1 and the
circumstances of Law 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded), 25.7 (Restriction on the
striker’s runner) or Law 34 (Hit the ball twice) apply, the umpire shall
- disallow all runs to the batting side
- return any not out batter to his/her original end
- signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers if applicable
- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under 28.3.2.
28.4 Limitation of on side fielders
At the instant of the bowler’s delivery there shall not be more than two fielders, other than
the wicket-keeper, behind the popping crease on the on side. A fielder will be considered to
be behind the popping crease unless the whole of his/her person whether grounded or in
the air is in front of this line.
In the event of infringement of this Law by any fielder, the striker’s end umpire shall call and
signal No ball.
28.5 Fielders not to encroach on pitch
While the ball is in play and until the ball has made contact with the striker’s bat or person,
or has passed the striker’s bat, no fielder, other than the bowler, may have any part of
his/her person grounded on or extended over the pitch.
In the event of infringement of this Law by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper, the
bowler’s end umpire shall call and signal No ball as soon as possible after delivery of the
ball. Note, however, Law 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper).

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
44
28.6 Movement by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper
28.6.1 Any movement by any fielder, excluding the wicket-keeper, after the ball comes into

striker’s wicket that does not significantly alter the position of the fielder.
28.6.1.3 movement by any fielder in response to the stroke that the striker is playing
or that his/her actions suggest he/she intends to play.
28.6.2 In all circumstances Law 28.4 (Limitation of on side fielders) shall apply.
28.6.3 In the event of such unfair movement, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and

LAW 29
THE WICKET IS BROKEN
29.1 The wicket is broken
The wicket is broken when at least one bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or
one or more stumps is removed from the ground.
29.2 Breaking the wicket fairly
29.2.1 The wicket is broken fairly if a bail is completely removed from the top of the
stumps, or a stump is struck out of the ground,
29.2.1.1 by the ball,
29.2.1.2 by the striker’s bat if held or by any part of the bat that he/she is holding,
29.2.1.3 for the purpose of this law only, by the striker's bat not in hand, or by any part
of the bat which has become detached,
29.2.1.4 by the striker’s person or by any part of his/her clothing or equipment
becoming detached from his/her person. However, any detached equipment
shall not include the striker’s protective helmet, or any part thereof, as defined
in Appendix A.2.3,
29.2.1.5 by a fielder with his/her hand or arm, providing that the ball is held in the
hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used.
29.2.1.6 The wicket is also broken fairly if a fielder strikes or pulls a stump out of
the ground as in 29.2.1.5.
29.2.2 The disturbance of a bail, whether temporary or not, shall not constitute its complete
removal from the top of the stumps, but if a bail in falling lodges between two of the
stumps this shall be regarded as complete removal.
29.3 One bail off
If one bail is off, it shall be sufficient for the purpose of breaking the wicket to remove the
remaining bail or to strike or pull any of the three stumps out of the ground, in any of the
ways stated in 29.2.

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
45
29.4 Remaking wicket
If a wicket is broken while the ball is in play, it shall not be remade by an umpire until the
ball is dead. See Law 20 (Dead ball). Any fielder may, however, while the ball is in play,
- replace a bail or bails on top of the stumps.
- put back one or more stumps into the ground where the wicket originally stood.
29.5 Dispensing with bails
If the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails in accordance with Law 8.5 (Dispensing
with bails), it is for the umpire concerned to decide whether or not the wicket has been
broken.
29.5.1 After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been broken fairly if the umpire
concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker’s bat,
person or items of his/her clothing or equipment as described in 29.2.1.2, 29.2.1.3 or
29.2.1.4, or by a fielder in the manner described in 29.2.1.5.
29.5.2 If the wicket has already been broken, 29.5.1 shall apply to any stump or stumps still
in the ground. Any fielder may replace a stump or stumps, in accordance with 29.4, in
order to have an opportunity of breaking the wicket fairly.
LAW 30
BATTER OUT OF HIS/HER GROUND
30.1 When out of his/her ground
30.1.1 A batter shall be considered to be out of his/her ground unless some part of his/her
person or bat is grounded behind the popping crease at that end.
30.1.2 However, a batter shall not be considered to be out of his/her ground if, in running or
diving towards his/her ground and beyond, and having grounded some part of his/her
person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is subsequent loss of contact
between the ground and any part of his/her person or bat,
or between the bat and person.
30.2 Which is a batter’s ground
30.2.1 If only one batter is within a ground, it is his/her ground and will remain so even if
he/she is later joined there by the other batter.
30.2.2 If both batters are in the same ground and one of them subsequently leaves it, the
ground belongs to the batter who remains in it.
30.2.3 If there is no batter in either ground, then each ground belongs to whichever batter is
nearer to it, or, if the batters are level, to whichever batter was nearer to it
immediately prior to their drawing level.
30.2.4 If a ground belongs to one batter then, unless there is a striker who has a runner, the
other ground belongs to the other batter, irrespective of his/her position.
30.2.5 When a batter who has a runner is striker, his/her ground is always at the wicket-
keeper’s end. However, 30.2.1, 30.2.2, 30.2.3 and 30.2.4 will still apply, but only to
the runner and the non-striker, so that that ground will also belong to either the non-
striker or the runner, as the case may be.
30.3 Position of non-striker
The non-striker, when standing at the bowler’s end, should be positioned on the opposite
side of the wicket to that from which the ball is being delivered, unless a request to do
otherwise is granted by the umpire.

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
46
LAW 31
APPEALS
31.1 Umpire not to give batter out without an appeal
Neither umpire shall give a batter out, even though he/she may be out under the Laws,
unless appealed to by a fielder. This shall not debar a batter who is out under any of the
Laws from leaving the wicket without an appeal having been made. Note, however, the
provisions of 31.7.
31.2 Batter dismissed
A batter is dismissed if he/she is
either
given out by an umpire, on appeal
or
out under any of the Laws and leaves the wicket as in 31.1.
31.3 Timing of appeals
For an appeal to be valid, it must be made before the bowler begins his/her run-up or, if
there is no run-up, his/her bowling action to deliver the next ball, and before Time has been
called.
The call of Over does not invalidate an appeal made prior to the start of the following over,
provided Time has not been called. See Laws 12.2 (Call of Time) and 17.2 (Start of an
over).
31.4 Appeal “How’s That?”
An appeal “How’s That?” covers all ways of being out.
31.5 Answering appeals
The striker’s end umpire shall answer all appeals arising out of any of Laws 35 (Hit wicket),
39 (Stumped) or 38 (Run out) when this occurs at the wicket-keeper’s end. The bowler’s
end umpire shall answer all other appeals.
When an appeal is made, each umpire shall answer on any matter that falls within his/her
jurisdiction.
When a batter has been given Not out, either umpire may answer an appeal, made in
accordance with 31.3, if it is on a further matter and is within his/her jurisdiction.
31.6 Consultation by umpires
Each umpire shall answer appeals on matters within his/her own jurisdiction. If an umpire is
doubtful about any point that the other umpire may have been in a better position to see,
he/she shall consult the latter on this point of fact and shall then give the decision. If, after
consultation, there is still doubt remaining, the decision shall be Not out.
31.7 Batter leaving the wicket under a misapprehension
An umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batter, not having been given out, has left the
wicket under a misapprehension of being out. The umpire intervening shall call and signal
Dead ball to prevent any further action by the fielding side and shall recall the batter.
A batter may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the
next delivery, unless it is the final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the
instant when the umpires leave the field.
31.8 Withdrawal of an appeal
The captain of the fielding side may withdraw an appeal only after obtaining the consent of
the umpire within whose jurisdiction the appeal falls. If such consent is given, the umpire
concerned shall, if applicable, revoke the decision and recall the batter.
The withdrawal of an appeal must be before the instant when the ball comes into play for the
next delivery or, if the innings has been completed, the instant when the umpires leave the
field.

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)

LAW 32
BOWLED
32.1 Out Bowled
32.1.1 The striker is out Bowled if his/her wicket is broken by a ball delivered by the
bowler, not being a No ball, even if it first touches the striker’s bat or person.
32.1.2 However, the striker shall not be out Bowled if before striking the wicket the ball has
been in contact with any other player or an umpire. The striker will, however, be
subject to Laws 37 (Obstructing the field), 38 (Run out) and 39 (Stumped).
32.2 Bowled to take precedence
The striker is out Bowled if his/her wicket is broken as in 32.1, even though a decision
against him/her for any other method of dismissal would be justified.
LAW 33   
CAUGHT
33.1 Out Caught
The striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, touches his/her
bat without having previously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a
fielder as a fair catch, as described in 33.2 and 33.3, before it touches the ground.
33.2 A fair catch
33.2.1 A catch will be fair only if, in every case
either the ball, at any time
or
any fielder in contact with the ball,
is not grounded beyond the boundary before the catch is completed. Note Laws 19.4
(Ball grounded beyond the boundary) and 19.5 (Fielder grounded beyond the
boundary).
33.2.2 Furthermore, a catch will be fair if any of the following conditions applies:
33.2.2.1 the ball is held in the hand or hands of a fielder, even if the hand holding the
ball is touching the ground, or is hugged to the body, or lodges in the external
protective equipment worn by a fielder, or lodges accidentally in a fielder’s
clothing.
33.2.2.2 a fielder catches the ball after it has been lawfully struck more than once by
the striker, but only if it has not been grounded since it was first struck. See
Law 34 (Hit the ball twice).
33.2.2.3 a fielder catches the ball after it has touched the wicket, an umpire, another
fielder, a runner or the other batter.
33.2.2.4 a fielder catches the ball after it has crossed the boundary in the air, provided
that the conditions in 33.2.1 are met.
33.2.2.5 the ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that is not
designated a boundary by the umpires.
33.3 Making a catch
The act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact
with a fielder’s person and shall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the
ball and his/her own movement.
33.4 No runs to be scored
If the striker is dismissed Caught, runs from that delivery completed by the batters before
the completion of the catch shall not be scored but any runs for penalties awarded to either
side shall stand. The non-striker shall return to his/her original end. See Law 18.11 (Batter
returning to original end).

Laws of Cricket 2017 Code (3rd Edition - 2022)
48
33.5 Caught to take precedence
If the criteria of 33.1 are met and the striker is not out Bowled, then he/she is out Caught,
even though a decision against either batter for another method of dismissal would be
justified.
LAW 34
HIT THE BALL TWICE
34.1 Out Hit the ball twice
34.1.1 The striker is out Hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of
his/her person or is struck by his/her bat and, before the ball has been touched by a

not holding the bat, except for the sole purpose of guarding his/her wicket. See 34.3
and Law 37 (Obstructing the field).
34.1.2 For the purpose of this Law ‘struck’ or ‘strike’ shall include contact with the person of
the striker.

The striker may, solely in order to guard his/her wicket and before the ball has been
touched by a fielder, lawfully strike the ball a second or subsequent time with the bat, or
with any part of his/her person other than a hand not holding the bat.
The striker may guard his/her wicket even if the delivery is a No ball.
However, the striker may not prevent the ball from being caught by striking the ball more
than once in defence of his/her wicket. See Law 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught).
34.4 Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once
When the ball is lawfully struck more than once, as permitted in 34.3, if the ball does not
become dead for any reason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball
reaches the boundary or at the completion of the first run. However, he/she shall delay the
call of Dead ball to allow the opportunity for a catch to be completed.
The umpire shall
- disallow all runs to the batting side
- return any not out batter to his/her original end
- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable.

36.1.2 the ball, if it is not intercepted full-pitch, pitches in line between wicket and wicket or
on the off side of the striker’s wicket
36.1.3 the ball not having previously touched his/her bat, the striker intercepts the ball,
either full-pitch or after pitching, with any part of his/her person

be returned to their original ends on that account.
